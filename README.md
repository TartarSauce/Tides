Tides
=====

Tides is another homework assignment that was done in the second part of the iOS class that I took at UW. 

The objective of this program is to provide a list cities in the vicinity of the user's location where tide data is known. 

The program will run either on an iPhone 6 or an iPhone 6.1 simulator. 

All files in this project that are prefixed PCE are helper files provided by the instructor, the rest are my code. 

When you have loaded the code on the device, hit the refresh button on the top right corner to populate the screen with a list of locations with known tide data. Hitting the right detail button takes you to another screen where more info is available about tides at that specific location.
